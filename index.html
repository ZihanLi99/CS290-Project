        <p>Dumpling, formerly known as “Jiao er” because the shape is similar to ear , is a traditional flour dish of
            the
            Han nationality. It was invented by Zhongjing Zhang in Nanyang in the Eastern Han Dynasty and was originally
            used as a medicine. Dumpling is popular among the Chinese people and is a staple food and local snack in
            northern China. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is also a festival food. There is a proverb: “October
            1st, the winter
            solstice
            is
            here,
            every
            family will eat dumplings.” Dumpling is mostly boiled with dough with stuffing. Because dumpling is made
            with
            different fillings, it is called different kinds of names. For example: pork and cabbage dumplings, mutton
            dumplings, red oil dumplings and so on. There are also many ways to cook dumplings, such as boiling,
            steaming
            and frying.
